// This module is a feeder for VJoy virtual joystick driver. DS4Windows can optionally re-map and feed buttons and analog axis values from DS4 Controller to VJoy device.
// At first this may seem silly because DS4Windows can already do re-mapping by using a virtual X360 Controller driver, so why feed VJoy virtual driver also? 
// Sometimes X360 driver may run out of analog axis options, so for example "SA motion sensor steering wheel emulation" in DS4Windows would reserve a thumbstick X or Y 
// axis for SA steering wheel emulation usage. That thumbstick axis would be unavailable for "normal" thumbstick usage after this re-mapping. 
// The problem can be solved by configuring DS4Windows to re-map SA steering wheel emulation axis to VJoy axis, so all analog axies in DS4 controller are still available for normal usage.
